        <h2>about</h2>
        <p>music is tied to our cherished spaces and memories. whether a song reminds you of home, your favorite person, the worst time in your life or the best, music brings us to a time and place. on “mapping music”, you can share those memories, as well as explore others’ nearby (and across the world).</p>
        <br><p>“mapping music” was made as my final project in <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring25/CSCI-UA.0004-004/common-syllabus/">“intro to web design”</a> at NYU. It was inspired by <a href="https://www.queeringthemap.com/">queering the map</a>, a site where users can pin their queer memories on a map. </p>

        <br><h2>code</h2>
        <p>The map data is from OpenStreetMap and presented by <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, which I learned how to use in a prior JavaScript class, but solidified my code using their <a href="https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/">quick start guide</a>. I’m using <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Google Firebase</a> to store the pin data, and learned how to implement that into my map <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup">here</a>. All credit is properly listed within the JavaScript file as well. </p>
        <br><p>All credit is given in my JavaScript and CSS files.
          All other HTML, CSS and JavaScript was written by me, including text, images, semantic elements, grids & flexboxes, menu bar styling and DOM queries, functions, and @media queries.</p>
